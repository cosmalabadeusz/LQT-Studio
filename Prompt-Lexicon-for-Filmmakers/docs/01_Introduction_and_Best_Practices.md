## Introduction and Best Practices

### Main takeaway

Use precise, production-grade terminology to describe a single scene with clear subject, action, scene context, camera grammar, lighting, lens intent, and style. Favor direct, positive phrasing and anchor prompts in industry terms that engines like Google Veo/Imagen and Runway recognize. For image-to-video, describe motion only.

### Platform-aligned best practices

- Be explicit and concise; avoid conversational hedging. Prefer “Low-angle close-up, dim low-key lighting” to vague descriptions.
- Use positive phrasing; describe what to include (avoid “no/without”).
- Focus on one moment per prompt; create separate clips for multi-beat stories.
- Image-to-video: describe camera motion, subject motion, and environmental motion only; do not re-describe visuals present in the source image.
- Dialogue formatting (video): Character says: Hello there. Avoid quotation marks to reduce subtitle rendering.
- Use aspect ratios explicitly per output: 16:9, 9:16, 1:1.
