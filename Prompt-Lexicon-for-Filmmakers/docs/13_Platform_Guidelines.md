## Platform-Specific Guidance

### Google Veo/Imagen and Runway Recommendations

- Structure (Veo-style): Subject + Action + Scene + Camera angle + Camera movement + Lens/DOF + Lighting + Style/Mood + Audio
- Single scene per prompt; sequence multi-beat stories as separate clips
- Image-to-video: prompt for motion only (camera motion, subject animation, environment)
- Dialogue formatting: Character says: … (avoid quotes)
- Runway references: visual references handle look/identity; text prompt controls action; avoid re-describing referenced visuals
- Positive, direct language; avoid negative prompts and redundant restatements
