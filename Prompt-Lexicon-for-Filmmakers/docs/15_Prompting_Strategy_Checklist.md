## Prompting Strategy and Checklist

### Assembly checklist

- Define one scene and its key beat
- Lock angle, size, and movement
- State lens/DOF intent
- Specify lighting type, quality, and mood
- Add style/grade and texture cues
- Include atmospherics or physics as needed
- For video: add audio line(s) or ambience
- Confirm aspect ratio(s) and quality modifiers

### Key Strategies for Realistic Prompts

#### Use Photographic Language

Describe lighting precisely: Specify source, direction, and color temperature, such as “soft morning sunlight from the left” or “warm golden hour lighting”.

Mention camera settings: Add terms like “shot on DSLR, 50mm lens, f/1.8 aperture, 8K resolution, cinematic lighting, HDR” to push for a photorealistic look.

For Nano Banana, request micro-details: “Preserve skin texture, pores and subtle imperfections to add realism, maintain natural proportions, sharpen eyes with natural catchlights, increase micro-contrast and avoid plastic smoothing”.
