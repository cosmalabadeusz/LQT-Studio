## Lens, Optics, and Depth

### Lens intent

- Wide-angle (e.g., 18/24/35mm; expansive, perspective exaggeration)
- Standard/Normal (50mm; natural perspective)
- Telephoto (85/135/200mm; compression, isolation)
- Macro (extreme detail), Fisheye (extreme barrel distortion)
- Anamorphic look (oval bokeh, horizontal flares, widescreen aspect)

### Focus and depth

- Shallow depth of field; Deep focus; Selective focus; Rack focus; Focus pull
- Bokeh character (creamy, swirly, specular discs)
- Hyperfocal emphasis; Plane of focus language

### Optical effects

- Lens flare, Ghosting, Chromatic aberration, Halation, Bloom
- Vertigo effect/Dolly zoom (size constant, background warps)
