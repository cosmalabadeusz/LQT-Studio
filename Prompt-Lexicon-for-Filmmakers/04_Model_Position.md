## Model Position and Camera Angles

### I. Model's Orientation

These terms describe how the model positions their face and body relative to the lens (horizontally).

| English Term | Polish Translation (Reference) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Head-on / Straight-on / Full-frontal** | Na wprost / Cały przód | The model's face and entire body are directed straight into the lens. |
| **Three-quarter angle / Three-quarter view / Three-quarter profile** | Trzy czwarte (3/4) / Półprofil | The model is turned about **45 degrees** away from the camera. A very popular and flattering angle, often slimming and revealing facial features effectively. |
| **Two-thirds angle / Two-thirds view** | Półprofil | A position where the model is turned slightly more than a three-quarter view, but not fully in profile. |
| **Profile / Full profile** | Profil | The model is turned completely sideways to the camera (**90 degrees**). Only one side of the face and the body outline are visible. Used to emphasize the jawline or silhouette. |
| **Three-quarter rear view** | Pół tyłem | The model is turned away from the camera, but with a slight twist, so that the back of the body and a small portion of the profile are visible. |

### II. Vertical Camera Angle

These terms describe the height of the camera in relation to the model.

| English Term | Polish Translation (Reference) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Eye-level shot / Eye-level angle** | Na poziomie wzroku | The camera is at the same height as the model's eyes. This is a neutral, natural angle that creates a sense of equality and closeness. |
| **High angle shot / Down shot** | Z góry | The camera is positioned higher than the model and aimed downwards. Can make the model look smaller, more vulnerable, or less dominant. |
| **Low angle shot** | Z dołu | The camera is positioned lower than the model and aimed upwards. Makes the model appear taller, more dominant, strong, or monumental. |
