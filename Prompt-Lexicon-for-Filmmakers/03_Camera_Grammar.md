## Camera Grammar

### Camera angles and shot sizes

#### Angles

- Eye-level (neutral), High-angle (dominance reduction), Low-angle (power), Worm’s-eye (extreme low)
- Bird’s-eye / Overhead / Top-down (map-like), Aerial/Drone
- Dutch / Canted / Oblique angle (tilted horizon; disorientation)
- Over-the-shoulder (OTS), Point-of-view (POV)

#### Shot sizes

- Extreme wide (XWS), Wide/Long (WS/LS), Full shot
- Medium (MS), Medium close-up (MCU), Close-up (CU), Extreme close-up (ECU)
- Two-shot, Three-shot, Group shot
- Establishing / Re-establishing

### Camera movement

#### Fundamental
- Static/fixed
- Pan (L/R), Tilt (U/D), Roll
- Dolly (in/out), Truck/Track (left/right), Pedestal (up/down)
- Zoom (lens focal change; distinct from dolly)

#### Advanced
- Arc shot (circular move), Crane/Jib (vertical sweeps, reveals)
- Tracking/follow shot (subject-aligned movement)
- Whip pan (rapid, blurred transition), Push-in, Pull-out
- Handheld/shaky cam (documentary feel), Steadicam (stabilized float)

### Framing and composition

#### Structure and guidance
- Rule of thirds; Centered/symmetry; Balance/asymmetry
- Leading lines; Frame-in-frame; Negative space
- Layering: Foreground/Middleground/Background; deep space
- Headroom; Noseroom/Lead room; Horizon placement
- Blocking and staging (crosses, silhouette read, clean contours)
